## Description
After pressing a new game, you select the basic game mode, which is the only game mode available for the moment. You closely read the screen guidelines and observe the gameboard, seven dotted game pieces and four pyramid dice. You note that each dice has two pips.
You take the first turn and roll the dice. You rolled two pips facing top, therefore, you move a dotted piece to the second square by selecting it. Computer opponent rolled three, therefore a dotted piece has been moved to the third square from the starting position. You roll the dice again and get all four pips facing top!You move another dotted piece directly to the fourth square by selecting it. Since the forth
square is a rosette, your game piece is now safe from the opponent as long as it stays on this square. Since you landed on a rosette, you also get an extra turn. You roll again...
After a while you managed to get five of your pieces around and off the board and your opponent only managed to get two of the pieces off the board. You continue to race to your victory...
